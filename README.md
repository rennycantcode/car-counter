# Car Counting with YOLO and SORT

This Python script utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm to count the number of cars in a given video. The code uses the Ultralytics YOLO implementation, OpenCV, and other libraries for efficient object detection and tracking.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the required libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy
